Included files:
1. lab1b-client.c: Supports --port=portNumber, --compress, and --log=filename arguments.
Creates a client that takes in input from stdin and sends it stdout and to the server via 
a socket on a specified port number. Input that is received from the socket is written to 
stdout. If --log=filename is entered, it logs all input from stdin after compression (if 
applicable) and logs all output from the socket before decompresssing (if applicable).
2. lab1b-server.c: Supports --port=portNumber and --compress arguments.
Creates a server that communicates with the client on the specified port number through
a socket. The server creates a child process that runs a bash shell. All input from the
socket is sent to the child process, and all output from the child process (shell) is 
sent back to the client via pipes and the socket. If compression is used, it decompresses
input from the client and compresses output from the child process (shell).
3. Makefile: has default, clean, dist, lab1b-client, and lab1b-server targets.
Default builds both lab1b-client and lab1b-server executables.
Clean removes all object files and tarball files from the directory.
lab1b-client creates only the lab1b-client executable.
lab1b-server creates only the lab1b-server executable.
