Description of files:
1.  lab0.c reads the contents of fd0 to fd1, taking in optional arguments for --input, --output, --segfault, and --catch. 
    It copies the contents of fd0 with a read(2) and performs a write(2) to fd1. 
    If no input and output arguments are entered, input is taken from standard input and outputted into standard output.
2.  Makefile provides 4 targets: 
    1) default: build the lab0 executable
    2) dist: builds the distribution tarball
    3) check: runs the smoke test script
    4) clean: removes any files/executables created by Make
3. smoke_tests.sh is a bash script that tests lab0 with these cases:
    Case 1) Tests for correct input/output redirection and reading/writing when given a valid input file and output file
    Case 2) Tests for returning with exit code 1 when given an invalid argument
    Case 3) Tests for returning with exit code 2 when given an invalid input file
    Case 4) Tests for returning with exit code 3 when given an invalid output file (e.g. no writing permissions)
    Case 5) Tests for catching a segfault and returning with exit code 4
    Case 6) Tests for creating a segfault
