Included files:
1. lab1.c: Creates an i/o terminal that optionally supports a bash shell with the '--shell' argument. 
    This shell is created by forking from the current parent process and using execlp. With the use of 2 pipes 
    from the parent(terminal) to the child(shell) and from the child(shell) back to the parent(terminal), this program
    forwards input to the shell to process commands, and send the results back to the terminal with the help of poll(2)
    to facilitate handling input/output between processes through the respective pipes.
2. Makefile: Supports default, dist, and clean targets.
3. README: This current file which provides file descriptions and sources.
